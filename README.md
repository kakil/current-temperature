# Get Current Temperature for Any Place

## Project Brief
What’s the temperature in the Rovaniemi right now?

Let’s find it out with Python.

Your task for this project is to create a Python program that gets any city name as input and outputs the current temperature for that city.


## Expected Output
When the program is executed, the terminal asks the user to enter a city. Once the user enters the city, the program outputs the temperature of that city as shown in the demo below.


## Environment Setup Instructions
* Install the required libraries with: pip install requests
* Create a free account and get an API key from https://openweathermap.org
